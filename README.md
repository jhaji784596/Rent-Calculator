# Rent-Calculator
This repository contains a simple Python-based Rent Calculator script designed to help roommates or flatmates fairly split their monthly expenses. Users input the total rent amount, the cost of food/snacking, total electricity units consumed, the electricity charge per unit, and the number of persons sharing the accommodation.
