# Rent Calculator by @jhaji

## Project Overview
This Rent Calculator is a simple Python program designed to fairly split the overall monthly expenses among roommates living in a shared accommodation such as a hostel or flat. It calculates the individual share based on rent, food expenses, and electricity consumption.

## Features
- Input for total rent (kiraya), food (khana) expenses, electricity units used, charge per electricity unit, and number of persons sharing the rent.
- Calculates total electricity bill by multiplying units consumed by the charge per unit.
- Computes the total expense per person by summing rent, food, and electricity charge, then dividing by the number of persons.
- Outputs the amount each person needs to pay.

## Technologies Used
- Python (standard input/output functions)

## How to Use
1. Run the Python script.
2. Enter the following details when prompted:
   - Hostel/flat rent amount
   - Amount spent on food (khana)
   - Total electricity units consumed
   - Charge per unit of electricity
   - Number of people sharing the expenses
3. View the calculated rent share per person printed on the screen.

## Example Interaction
```
Enter your hostel/flat kiraya = 5000
Enter the amount of khana ordered = 2000
Enter the total electricity units used = 150
Enter charge per unit = 5
Enter the number of persons living in flat = 4
Each person pays = 2375
Thank you for using the Rent Calculator!

## Project Context (aligned with Build Your Own Project guidelines)
- The project addresses the need to manage shared accommodation expenses transparently and easily.
- It fulfills functional requirements by taking multiple inputs, performing arithmetic calculations, and providing a clear output.
- Non-functional requirements such as usability are met through a simple command-line interface and clear prompts.
- The project is modular enough for extension, such as adding validations or GUI enhancements.

## Future Enhancements
- Add input validation and error handling.
- Develop a graphical user interface (GUI).
- Include options for additional shared expenses.
- Save and track monthly payments.
